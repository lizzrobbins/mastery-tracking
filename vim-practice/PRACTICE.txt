This is my vim practice. I pressed i in order to being INSERTing into this doc.

Next, I will hit esc to get out of the insert mode.

Once I get out of the insert mode, I will type :w in order to save the file... w means written..

Then, I will type :q in order to quit and go back to the terminal..

I entered :q! in order to quit without saving.

and that's that!!

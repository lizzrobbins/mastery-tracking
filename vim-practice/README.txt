Hi there! This is my vim practice. I pressed i in order to begin INSERTing into this doc.

Next, I will hit esc to get out of the insert mode.

Once I get out of insert mode, I will type :w in order to save the file - w means WRITTEN.

Then, I will type :q in order to quit and go back to the terminal.

This is me quitting without saving.
